# Welcome to the AJMN DLS project!

This project was built on top of the [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) framework using the [Foundation libsass template](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-libsass-template). All of the CSS markup is written in [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). Sass is the easiest way to customize Foundation. 

I've set up the project on my machine with the help of [CodeKit](https://incident57.com/codekit/). Although its fairly easy to [set up a new project using the command line](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html), Foundation is one of the default frameworks available when creating a new project with CodeKit. 

>With zero setup and [Bower](http://bower.io/) built right into the system, CodeKit can compile any language with one click updates. From auto-refresh browsers to built-in minifiers, CodeKit has everything inside to help you get started.
