		<p>This <span class="bold">Design Language Sysytem</span> is a living, breathing dynamic style guide for the design of our products. We wish to give our products a unique but consistent look and feel. Our DLS describes choices for design aspects such as colour schemes, patterns, templates, and layouts.</p>
		<h3>Goals</h3>
		<p>The goal is to give our products a <span class="bold">strong thematic quality</span> while ensuring brand and code consistency. The DLS aims to establish a common language, make testing easier, save time and effort, and create a useful reference for our teams. Most importantly, our design language system will create a <span class="bold">future-friendly foundation</span> for our network to modify, extend, and evolve over time.</p>
