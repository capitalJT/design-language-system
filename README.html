<h1>Welcome to the AJMN DLS project!</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>DLS is short for Design Language System. Al Jazeera&rsquo;s Design Language Sysytem is a living, breathing dynamic style guide for the design of our products. We wish to give our products a unique but consistent look and feel. Our DLS describes choices for design aspects such as colour schemes, patterns, templates, and layouts.</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<p>The goal is to give our products a strong thematic quality while ensuring brand and code consistency. The DLS aims to establish a common language, make testing easier, save time and effort, and create a useful reference for our teams. Most importantly, our design language system will create a future-friendly foundation for our network to modify, extend, and evolve over time.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>This project was built on top of the <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Zurb Foundation</a> framework using the <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation-libsass-template">Foundation libsass template</a>. All of the CSS markup is written in <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>. Sass is the easiest way to customize Foundation.</p>

<p>Its fairly easy to <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html">set up a new project using the command line</a>. Here&rsquo;s a walk through <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/learn/video-started-with-foundation.html">video</a> of how to install Foundation with Sass using <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> and <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>. I&rsquo;ve set up the project on my machine with the help of <a href="https://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a>. Foundation is one of the default frameworks available when creating a new project with CodeKit.</p>

<blockquote><p>With zero setup and built right into the system, CodeKit can compile any language with one click updates. From auto-refresh browsers to built-in minifiers, CodeKit has everything inside to help you get started.</p></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://patternlab.io/about.html">Atomic Design Methodology</a> was one of the main inspirations for the DLS.</p>
