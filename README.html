<h1>Welcome to the AJMN DLS project!</h1>

<p>This project was built on top of the <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Zurb Foundation</a> framework using the <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation-libsass-template">Foundation libsass template</a>. All of the CSS markup is written in <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>. Sass is the easiest way to customize Foundation.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve set up the project on my machine with the help of <a href="https://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a>. Although its fairly easy to <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html">set up a new project using the command line</a>, Foundation is one of the default frameworks available when creating a new project with CodeKit.</p>

<blockquote><p>With zero setup and <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> built right into the system, CodeKit can compile any language with one click updates. From auto-refresh browsers to built-in minifiers, CodeKit has everything inside to help you get started.</p></blockquote>
