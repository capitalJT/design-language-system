<h1>Welcome to the AJMN DLS project!</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>DLS is short for Design Language System. Al Jazeera&rsquo;s Design Language Sysytem is a living, breathing dynamic style guide for the design of our products. We wish to give our products a unique but consistent look and feel. Our DLS describes choices for design aspects such as colour schemes, patterns, templates, and layouts.</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<p>The goal is to give our products a strong thematic quality while ensuring brand and code consistency. The DLS aims to establish a common language, make testing easier, save time and effort, and create a useful reference for our teams. Most importantly, our design language system will create a future-friendly foundation for our network to modify, extend, and evolve over time.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>The DLS is built on top of the <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Zurb Foundation</a> framework using the <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation-libsass-template">Foundation libsass template</a>. All of the CSS markup is written in <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>. Sass is the easiest way to customize Foundation.</p>

<p>Its fairly easy to <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.html">set up a new project using the command line</a>. Here&rsquo;s a walk through <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/learn/video-started-with-foundation.html">video</a> of how to install Foundation with Sass using <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> and <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>. I&rsquo;ve set up the project on my machine with the help of <a href="https://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>With zero setup and built right into the system, CodeKit can compile any language with one click updates. From auto-refresh browsers to built-in minifiers, CodeKit has everything inside to help you get started.</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the added benefits of CodeKit is that the app includes syntax checkers and provides helpful notifications for error messages. It tells you where the error occurred and suggests a solution.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://patternlab.io/about.html">Atomic Design Methodology</a> was one of the main inspirations for the DLS. The main idea is to design elements that can be built into components for the creation of dynamic templates. By utilizing PHP includes, components can be easily updated and shared throughout a project.</p>
