	<p>Tunisian security forces have begun a manhunt for a third attacker in the assault on the Bardo museum that killed 21 people, mostly foreign tourists, the president said.</p>
	<p>Beji Caid Essebsi spoke with French TV network iTele from inside the Bardo Museum on Sunday, saying the attack involved "three aggressors" and that the third man had escaped.</p>
	<p>Tunisia's Interior Ministry released security camera footage of Wednesday's attack showing two gunmen walking through the museum, carrying assault rifles and bags.</p>
	<h4>Guards on coffee break</h4>
	<p>A senior Tunisian politician on Friday said the guards supposed to be protecting the museum and the nearby Parliament were having coffee at the time of the assault.</p>
	<p>"I found out there were only four policemen on security duty around the Parliament [compound], two of whom were at the cafe. The third was having a snack and the fourth hadn't turned up," deputy speaker Abdelfattah Mourou told the AFP news agency</p>
